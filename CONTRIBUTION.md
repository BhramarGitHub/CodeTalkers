## Guidelines

Before submitting your PRs, please read the following guideline and make sure that your PR follows the same:

1. **PR Title:** The title of your PR must follow this format
    - **`<github-id>-<problem-no(in integers)>-<language-chosen>`**
    - For eg: If I am submitting the solution for the 1st problem, my PR title should be **`yatharth0045-1-java`**

2. **PR Description:** The PR Description can be left empty. Optionally, you can add any notes which you want us to know before we test your code.

3. **Solution Count:** Each PR should have a **solution for only 1** problem statement.

4. **Codebase Directory Structure:** For each solution that you contribute, please **maintain the following directory structure**

    ```
    CodeTalkers/
        |--- <problem-no>/
                |--- <github-name>/
                        |--- solution.format
                        |--- run.md (Compilation & Running Steps)
    ```

    For example: If I am contributing for the 1st problem statement, I'm going to follow the below provided directory structure
    
    ```
    CodeTalkers/
        |--- Q1/ 
             |--- yatharth0045/
                    |--- Solution.java
                    |--- run.md
    ```

5. **`run.md` format:** The `run.md` file will contain 2 information
